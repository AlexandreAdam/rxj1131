abstract = {Nested sampling estimates directly how the likelihood function relates to prior mass. The evidence (alternatively the marginal likelihood, marginal density of the data, or the prior predictive) is immediately obtained by summation. It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the "nested"contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic relabelling) allows the method to deal with a class of phasechange problems which effectively defeat thermal annealing. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.},

@article{Wong2020,
abstract = {We present a measurement of the Hubble constant (H0) and other cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of six gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays. All lenses except the first are analysed blindly with respect to the cosmological parameters. In a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, we find a precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of H0 from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in 3.1$\sigma$ tension with Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in 5.3$\sigma$ tension with Planck CMB determinations of H0 in flat $\Lambda$CDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat $\Lambda$CDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from Planck, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the tension with Planck. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our H0 inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on H0 ranges from ∼73 to 78 km s-1 Mpc-1, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful technique for probing galaxy mass distributions and for measuring cosmological parameters. Lens systems with extended source-intensity distributions are particularly useful for this purpose since they provide additional constraints on the lens potential (mass distribution). We present a pixelated approach to modeling the lens potential and source-intensity distribution simultaneously. The method makes iterative and perturbative corrections to an initial potential model. For systems with sources of sufficient extent such that the separate lensed images are connected by intensity measurements, the accuracy in the reconstructed potential is solely limited by the quality of the data. We apply this potential reconstruction technique to deep Hubble Space Telescope observations of B1608+656, a four-image gravitational lens system formed by a pair of interacting lens galaxies. We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the system that takes into account the extended source-intensity distribution, dust extinction, and the interacting lens galaxies. Our approach allows us to compare various models of the components of the lens system, which include the point-spread function (PSF), dust, lens galaxy light, source-intensity distribution, and lens potential. Using optimal combinations of the PSF, dust, and lens galaxy light models, we successfully reconstruct both the lens potential and the extended source-intensity distribution of B1608+656. The resulting reconstruction can be used as the basis of a measurement of the Hubble constant. As an illustration of the astrophysical applications of our method, we use our reconstruction of the gravitational potential to study the relative distribution of mass and light in the lensing galaxies. We find that the mass-to-light ratio for the primary lens galaxy is (2.0 ± 0.2)h M{\textregistered} L -1B,{\textregistered}, within the Einstein radius (3.9 h-1 kpc), in agreement with what is found for noninteracting lens galaxies at the same scales. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {We present the results from nine years of optically monitoring the gravitationally lensed zQSO = 0.658 quasar RX J1131-1231. The R-band light curves of the four individual images of the quasar were obtained using deconvolution photometry for a total of 707 epochs. Several sharp quasar variability features strongly constrain the time delays between the quasar images. Using three different numerical techniques, we measured these delays for all possible pairs of quasar images while always processing the four light curves simultaneously. For all three methods, the delays between the three close images A, B, and C are compatible with being 0, while we measured the delay of image D to be 91 days, with a fractional uncertainty of 1.5% (1$\sigma$), including systematic errors. Our analysis of random and systematic errors accounts in a realistic way for the observed quasar variability, fluctuating microlensing magnification over a broad range of temporal scales, noise properties, and seasonal gaps. Finally, we find that our time-delay measurement methods yield compatible results when applied to subsets of the data. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2013.},

abstract = {The time delays between the multiple images of a strong lens system, together with a model of the lens mass distribution, allow a one-step measurement of a cosmological distance, namely, the 'time-delay distance' of the lens (D $\Delta$t) that encodes cosmological information. The time-delay distance depends sensitively on the radial profile slope of the lens mass distribution; consequently, the lens slope must be accurately constrained for cosmological studies. We show that the slope cannot be constrained in two-image systems with single-component compact sources, whereas it can be constrained in systems with two-component sources provided that the separation between the image components can be measured with milliarcsecond precisions, which is not feasible in most systems. In contrast, we demonstrate that spatially extended images of the source galaxy in two-image systems break the radial slope degeneracy and allow D $\Delta$t to be measured with uncertainties of a few per cent. Deep and high-resolution imaging of the lens systems are needed to reveal the extended arcs, and stable point spread functions are required for our lens modelling technique. Two-image systems, no longer plagued by the radial profile slope degeneracy, would augment the sample of useful time-delay lenses by a factor of ∼6, providing substantial advances for cosmological studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {We introduce dynamic nested sampling: A generalisation of the nested sampling algorithm in which the number of "live points" varies to allocate samples more efficiently. In empirical tests the new method significantly improves calculation accuracy compared to standard nested sampling with the same number of samples; this increase in accuracy is equivalent to speeding up the computation by factors of up to ∼ 72 for parameter estimation and ∼ 7 for evidence calculations. We also show that the accuracy of both parameter estimation and evidence calculations can be improved simultaneously. In addition, unlike in standard nested sampling, more accurate results can be obtained by continuing the calculation for longer. Popular standard nested sampling implementations can be easily adapted to perform dynamic nested sampling, several dynamic nested sampling software packages are now publicly available. 1.},
