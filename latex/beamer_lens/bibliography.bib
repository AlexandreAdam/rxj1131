abstract = {We present an improved determination of the Hubble constant from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of 70long-period Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). These were obtained with the same WFC3 photometric system used to measure extragalactic Cepheids in the hosts of SNe Ia. Gyroscopic control of HST was employed to reduce overheads while collecting a large sample of widely separated Cepheids. The Cepheid period-luminosity relation provides a zero-point-independent link with 0.4% precision between the new 1.2% geometric distance to the LMC from detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) measured by Pietrzy{\'{n}}ski et al. and the luminosity of SNe Ia. Measurements and analysis of the LMC Cepheids were completed prior to knowledge of the new DEB LMC distance. Combined with a refined calibration of the count-rate linearity of WFC3-IR with 0.1% precision, these three improved elements together reduce the overall uncertainty in the geometric calibration of the Cepheid distance ladder based on the LMC from 2.5% to 1.3%. Using only the LMC DEBs to calibrate the ladder, we find H 0 =74.22±1.82 km s −1 Mpc −1 including systematic uncertainties, 3% higher than before for this particular anchor. Combining the LMC DEBs, masers in NGC 4258, and Milky Way parallaxes yields our best estimate: H 0 =74.03±1.42 km s −1 Mpc −1 , including systematics, an uncertainty of 1.91%-15% lower than our best previous result. Removing any one of these anchors changes H 0 by less than 0.7%. The difference between H 0 measured locally and the value inferred from Planck CMB and $\Lambda$CDMis 6.6±1.5 km s −1 Mpc −1 or 4.4$\sigma$ (P=99.999% for Gaussian errors) in significance, raising the discrepancy beyond a plausible level of chance. We summarize independent tests showing that this discrepancy is not attributable to an error in any one source or measurement, increasing the odds that it results from a cosmological feature beyond $\Lambda$CDM.},

abstract = {Strong gravitational lenses with measured time delays between the multiple images and models of the lens mass distribution allow a one-step determination of the time-delay distance, and thus a measure of cosmological parameters. We present a blind analysis of the gravitational lens RXJ1131−1231 incorporating (1) the newly measured time delays from COSMOGRAIL, the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses, (2) archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the lens system, (3) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of the lens galaxy of 323 ± 20 km s −1 based on Keck spectroscopy, and (4) a characterization of the line-of-sight structures via observations of the lens' environment and ray tracing through the Millennium Simulation. Our blind analysis is designed to prevent experimenter bias. The joint analysis of the data sets allows a time-delay distance measurement to 6% precision that takes into account all known systematic uncertainties. In combination with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe seven-year (WMAP7) data set in flat wCDM cosmology, our unblinded cosmological constraints for RXJ1131−1231 are H 0 = 80.0 +5.8 −5.7 km s −1 Mpc −1 , $\Omega$ de = 0.79 ± 0.03, and w = −1.25 +0.17 −0.21. We find the results to be statistically consistent with those from the analysis of the gravitational lens B1608+656, permitting us to combine the inferences from these two lenses. The joint constraints from the two lenses and WMAP7 are H 0 = 75.2 +4.4 −4.2 km s −1 Mpc −1 , $\Omega$ de = 0.76 +0.02 −0.03 , and w = −1.14 +0.17 −0.20 in flat wCDM, and H 0 = 73.1 +2.4 −3.6 km s −1 Mpc −1 , $\Omega$ $\Lambda$ = 0.75 +0.01 −0.02 , and $\Omega$ k = 0.003 +0.005 −0.006 in open $\Lambda$CDM. Time-delay lenses constrain especially tightly the Hubble constant H 0 (5.7% and 4.0% respectively in wCDM and open $\Lambda$CDM) and curvature of the universe. The overall information content is similar to that of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation experiments. Thus, they complement well other cosmological probes, and provide an independent check of unknown systematics. Our measurement of the Hubble constant is completely independent of those based on the local distance ladder method, providing an important consistency check of the standard cosmological model and of general relativity.},

abstract = {We propose the novel method of 'gravitational imaging' to detect and quantify luminous and dark matter substructures in gravitational lens galaxies. The method utilizes highly magnified Einstein rings and arcs as sensitive probes of small perturbations in the lens potential (due to the presence of the mass substructure), reconstructing the gravitational lens potential non-parametrically. Numerical simulations show that the implemented algorithm can reconstruct the smooth mass distribution of a typical lens galaxy - exhibiting reasonable signal-to-noise Einstein rings - as well as compact substructure with masses as low as Msub ∼ 10-3 M lens, if present. 'Gravitational imaging' of pure dark matter substructures around massive galaxies can provide new insight into the standard cold dark matter paradigm, using very different physics than ground-based direct-detection experiments, and probe the hierarchical structure-formation model which predicts that this substructure exists in great abundance. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

abstract = {Strong gravitational lens systems with extended sources are of special interest because they provide additional constraints on the models of the lens systems. To use a gravitational lens system for measuring the Hubble constant, one would need to determine the lens potential and the source intensity distribution simultaneously. A linear inversion method to reconstruct a pixellated source brightness distribution of a given lens potential model was introduced by Warren & Dye. In the inversion process, regularization on the source intensity is often needed to ensure a successful inversion with a faithful resulting source. In this paper, we use Bayesian analysis to determine the optimal regularization constant (strength of regularization) of a given form of regularization and to objectively choose the optimal form of regularization given a selection of regularizations. We consider and compare quantitatively three different forms of regularization previously described in the literature for source inversions in gravitational lensing: zeroth-order, gradient and curvature. We use simulated data with the exact lens potential to demonstrate the method. We find that the preferred form of regularization depends on the nature of the source distribution. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {We examine the spatial and temporal stability of the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Wide Field Camera (WFC) point-spread function (PSF) using the 2 deg2 COSMOS survey. This is important for studies of weak gravitational lensing, where the ability to deconvolve the PSF from galaxy shapes is of paramount importance. We show that stochastic aliasing of the PSF necessarily occurs during ``drizzling.'' This aliasing is maximal if the output-pixel scale is equal to the input-pixel scale. This source of PSF variation can be significantly reduced by choosing a Gaussian drizzle kernel with a size of 0.8 input pixels and by reducing the output-pixel scale. We show that the PSF is temporally unstable, resulting in an overall slow periodic focus change in the COSMOS images. Using a modified version of the Tiny Tim PSF modeling software, we create grids of undistorted stars over a range of telescope focus values. We then use the approximately 10 well-measured stars in each COSMOS field to pick the best-fit focus value for each field. The Tiny Tim model stars can then be used to perform PSF corrections for weak lensing. We derive a parametric correction for the effect of charge transfer efficiency (CTE) degradation on the shapes of objects in the COSMOS field as a function of observation date, position within the ACS WFC field, and object flux. Finally, we discuss future plans to improve the CTE correction.

The answers that emerged from the workshop are (1) better measurements of H_0 provide critical independent constraints on dark energy, spatial curvature of the Universe, neutrino physics, and validity of general relativity, (2) a measurement of H_0 to 1% in both precision and accuracy, supported by rigorous error budgets, is within reach for several methods, and (3) multiple paths to independent determinations of H_0 are needed in order to access and control systematics.},

abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful technique for probing galaxy mass distributions and for measuring cosmological parameters. Lens systems with extended source-intensity distributions are particularly useful for this purpose since they provide additional constraints on the lens potential (mass distribution). We present a pixelated approach to modeling the lens potential and source-intensity distribution simultaneously. The method makes iterative and perturbative corrections to an initial potential model. For systems with sources of sufficient extent such that the separate lensed images are connected by intensity measurements, the accuracy in the reconstructed potential is solely limited by the quality of the data. We apply this potential reconstruction technique to deep Hubble Space Telescope observations of B1608+656, a four-image gravitational lens system formed by a pair of interacting lens galaxies. We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the system that takes into account the extended source-intensity distribution, dust extinction, and the interacting lens galaxies. Our approach allows us to compare various models of the components of the lens system, which include the point-spread function (PSF), dust, lens galaxy light, source-intensity distribution, and lens potential. Using optimal combinations of the PSF, dust, and lens galaxy light models, we successfully reconstruct both the lens potential and the extended source-intensity distribution of B1608+656. The resulting reconstruction can be used as the basis of a measurement of the Hubble constant. As an illustration of the astrophysical applications of our method, we use our reconstruction of the gravitational potential to study the relative distribution of mass and light in the lensing galaxies. We find that the mass-to-light ratio for the primary lens galaxy is (2.0 ± 0.2)h M{\textregistered} L -1B,{\textregistered}, within the Einstein radius (3.9 h-1 kpc), in agreement with what is found for noninteracting lens galaxies at the same scales. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {Strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between the multiple images provide a method for measuring the "time-delay distance" to the lens, and thus the Hubble constant. We present a Bayesian analysis of the strong gravitational lens system B1608+656, incorporating (1) new, deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, (2) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of 260 ± 15 km s-1 for the primary lens galaxy, and (3) an updated study of the lens' environment. Our analysis of the HST images takes into account the extended source surface brightness, and the dust extinction and optical emission by the interacting lens galaxies. When modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lens galaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitly include the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope $\gamma$′ and the external convergence $\kappa$ext; we marginalize over these parameters, assigning well-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors into statistical ones. The HST images provide one such prior, constraining the lens mass density profile logarithmic slope to be $\gamma$′ = 2.08 ± 0.03; a combination of numerical simulations and photometric observations of the B1608+656 field provides an estimate of the prior for $\kappa$ext: 0.10+0.08-0.05. This latter distribution dominates the final uncertainty on H 0. Fixing the cosmological parameters at $\Omega$m = 0.3, $\Omega$ $\Lambda$ = 0.7, and w = -1 in order to compare with previous work on this system, we find H 0 = 70.6+3.1-3.1 km s-1 Mpc-1. The new data provide an increase in precision of more than a factor of 2, even including the marginalization over $\kappa$ext. Relaxing the prior probability density function for the cosmological parameters to that derived from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) five-year data set, we find that the B1608+656 data set breaks the degeneracy between $\Omega$m and $\Omega$$\Lambda$ at w = -1 and constrains the curvature parameter to be -0.031 < $\Omega$k < 0.009 (95% CL), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the current Type Ia SNe sample. Asserting a flat spatial geometry, we find that, in combination with WMAP, H 0 = 69.7+4.9-5.0 km s-1 Mpc-1 and w = -0.94+0.17-0.19 (68% CL), suggesting that the observations of B1608+656 constrain w as tightly as the current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data do. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {The Cosmic Horseshoe gravitational lensing system is an extraordinary example of strong gravitational lensing both due to the nearly complete Einstein ring formed in this system and due to the star-forming nature of the lensed z=2.38 Lyman-break galaxy. In this paper, we describe the development of a new lens modeling package and the lens models produced using the Hubble Space Telescope imaging. Our new lens modeling package uses adaptive grid methods, based especially on the algorithm described by Vegetti & Koopmans. The new lens modeling package introduces the K-means method to deal with multiple background sources. We utilize two parameterized models, the singular isothermal ellipsoid and the Navarro-Frenk-White model in order to optimize the Bayesian penalty function. Color-color diagrams show two distinct colors exist in the Einstein ring, which suggests that the Cosmic Horseshoe is formed from two background galaxies or from a highly irregular galaxy. We find that the best lens model includes two components and the total mass within the Einstein ring is  ´  () M 5.43 0.08 10 12. The background source reconstruction shows two peaks in the source plane and the most probable lens profile is consistent with the light profile of the foreground galaxy when comparing axis ratios and position angles.},

abstract = {Strongly lensed quasar systems with time delay measurements provide “time delay distances”, which are a combination of three angular diameter distances and serve as powerful tools to determine the Hubble constant H0. However, current results often rely on the assumption of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here we use a model-independent method based on Gaussian process to directly constrain the value of H0. By using Gaussian process regression, we can generate posterior samples of unanchored supernova distances independent of any cosmological model and anchor them with strong lens systems. The combination of a supernova sample with large statistics but no sensitivity to H0 with a strong lens sample with small statistics but H0 sensitivity gives a precise H0 measurement without the assumption of any cosmological model. We use four well-analyzed lensing systems from the state-of-art lensing program H0LiCOW and the Pantheon supernova compilation in our analysis. Assuming the Universe is flat, we derive the constraint H0 = 72.2 ± 2.1 km/s/Mpc, a precision of 2.9%. Allowing for cosmic curvature with a prior of $\Omega$k = [−0.2, 0.2], the constraint becomes H0 = 73.0+2−3..80 km/s/Mpc.},

We demonstrate the method by reconstructing the mass distribution in a model cluster using simulated shear and magnification data to which Gaussian noise is added. The mass distribution is reconstructed directly and the inversion is regularized using the entropic prior for this positive additive distribution. For realistic noise levels, we find that the method faithfully reproduces the main features of the cluster mass distribution not only within the observed field but also slightly beyond it. We estimate the uncertainties in the reconstruction by calculating an analytic approximation to the covariance matrix of the reconstruction values of each pixel. This result is compared with error estimates derived from Monte Carlo simulations for different noise realizations and found to be in good agreement.},

From an abundance analysis of a high-resolution (R=75,000) VLT/UVES spectrum, we find HE 1523-0901 to be strongly overabundant in r-process elements ([r/Fe]=1.8). The abundances of heavy neutron-capture elements (Z>56) measured in HE 1523-0901 match the scaled solar r-process pattern extremely well. We detect the strongest optical U line at 3859.57 {\AA}. For the first time, we are able to employ several different chronometers, such as the U/Th, U/Ir, Th/Eu, and Th/Os ratios to measure the age of a star. The weighted average age of HE 1523-0901 is 13.2 Gyr. Several sources of uncertainties are assessed in detail.

abstract = {We present the results from nine years of optically monitoring the gravitationally lensed zQSO = 0.658 quasar RX J1131-1231. The R-band light curves of the four individual images of the quasar were obtained using deconvolution photometry for a total of 707 epochs. Several sharp quasar variability features strongly constrain the time delays between the quasar images. Using three different numerical techniques, we measured these delays for all possible pairs of quasar images while always processing the four light curves simultaneously. For all three methods, the delays between the three close images A, B, and C are compatible with being 0, while we measured the delay of image D to be 91 days, with a fractional uncertainty of 1.5% (1$\sigma$), including systematic errors. Our analysis of random and systematic errors accounts in a realistic way for the observed quasar variability, fluctuating microlensing magnification over a broad range of temporal scales, noise properties, and seasonal gaps. Finally, we find that our time-delay measurement methods yield compatible results when applied to subsets of the data. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2013.},

abstract = {Measuring time delays between the multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars is now recognized as a competitive way to constrain the cosmological parameters, and it is complementary with other cosmological probes. This requires long and well sampled optical light curves of numerous lensed quasars, such as those obtained by the COSMOGRAIL collaboration. High-quality data from our monitoring campaign call for novel numerical techniques to robustly measure the delays, as well as the associated random and systematic uncertainties, even in the presence of microlensing variations. We propose three different point estimators to measure time delays, which are explicitly designed to handle light curves with extrinsic variability. These methods share a common formalism, which enables them to process data from n-image lenses. Since the estimators rely on significantly contrasting ideas, we expect them to be sensitive to different bias sources. For each method and data set, we empirically estimate both the precision and accuracy (bias) of the time delay measurement using simulated light curves with known time delays that closely mimic the observations. Finally, we test the self-consistency of our approach, and we demonstrate that our bias estimation is serviceable. These new methods, including the empirical uncertainty estimator, will represent the standard benchmark for analyzing the COSMOGRAIL light curves. {\textcopyright} 2013 ESO.},

abstract = {We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant (H_0) from 3.3% to 2.4%. Improvements come from new, near-infrared observations of Cepheid variables in 11 new hosts of recent SNe$\sim$Ia, more than doubling the sample of SNe$\sim$Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance for a total of 19; these leverage the magnitude-z relation based on 300 SNe$\sim$Ia at z<0.15. All 19 hosts and the megamaser system NGC4258 were observed with WFC3, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors. Other improvements include a 33% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC4258, more Cepheids and a more robust distance to the LMC from late-type DEBs, HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes, and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. H_0 from each is 72.25+/-2.51, 72.04+/-2.67, 76.18+/-2.37, and 74.50+/-3.27 km/sec/Mpc, respectively. Our best estimate of 73.24+/-1.74 km/sec/Mpc combines the anchors NGC4258, MW, and LMC, and includes systematic errors for a final uncertainty of 2.4%. This value is 3.4 sigma higher than 66.93+/-0.62 km/sec/Mpc predicted by LambdaCDM with 3 neutrinos with mass 0.06 eV and the Planck data, but reduces to 2.1 sigma relative to the prediction of 69.3+/-0.7 km/sec/Mpc with the combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO, suggesting systematic uncertainties in CMB measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck and H_0 at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early Universe in the range of Delta N_eff=0.4-1. We anticipate significant improvements in H_0 from upcoming parallax measurements.},

abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter LCDM model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (theta_*) now known to 0.03%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the LCDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

abstract = {COSMOGRAIL is a long-term photometric monitoring of gravitationally lensed quasars aimed at implementing Refsdal's time-delay method to measure cosmological parameters, in particular H0. Given the long and well sampled light curves of strongly lensed quasars, time-delay measurements require numerical techniques whose quality must be assessed. To this end, and also in view of future monitoring programs or surveys such as the LSST, a blind signal processing competition named Time Delay Challenge 1 (TDC1) was held in 2014. The aim of the present paper, which is based on the simulated light curves from the TDC1, is double. First, we test the performance of the time-delay measurement techniques currently used in COSMOGRAIL. Second, we analyse the quantity and quality of the harvest of time delays obtained from the TDC1 simulations. To achieve these goals, we first discover time delays through a careful inspection of the light curves via a dedicated visual interface. Our measurement algorithms can then be applied to the data in an automated way. We show that our techniques have no significant biases, and yield adequate uncertainty estimates resulting in reduced $\chi$2 values between 0.5 and 1.0. We provide estimates for the number and precision of time-delay measurements that can be expected from future time-delay monitoring campaigns as a function of the photometric signal-to-noise ratio and of the true time delay. We make our blind measurements on the TDC1 data publicly available.},

        abstract = {We present a measurement of the Hubble constant (H0) and other cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of six gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays. All lenses except the first are analysed blindly with respect to the cosmological parameters. In a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, we find a precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of H0 from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in 3.1$\sigma$ tension with Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in 5.3$\sigma$ tension with Planck CMB determinations of H0 in flat $\Lambda$CDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat $\Lambda$CDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from Planck, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Allowing foratial curvature does not resolve the tension with Planck. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our H0 inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on H0 ranges from ∼73 to 78 km s-1 Mpc-1, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

The gravitational lens effect has previously been discussed by Liebes (1964) and Refsdal (1964, hereafter denoted Paper 1). A more detailed list of references can be found in these papers. The effect occurs when the light rays from a distance source S are deflected by a gravitational field, so that the apparent shape and luminosity of S are changed. In Paper 1 theecial case of a star B lying close to the line of sight to S was considered. B then acts as a gravi-tational lens and the apparent luminosity of S increases. It was also shown that the mass of B could be determined if the distance to B was known.

        abstract = {The so-called gravitational lens effect, previously worked out by Tikhov in 1937, is derived in a simple manner. The effect is caused by the gravitational deflection of light from a star S in the gravitational field of another star By and occurs when S lies far behind B, but close to the line of sight through B. It turns out that a considerable increase in the apparent luminosity of S is possible. A method is given to determine the mass of a star which acts as a gravitational lens. The possibility of observing the effect is discussed.},

@article{Barkana1998,
        abstract = {Because of their simplicity, axisymmetric mass distributions are often used to model gravitational lenses. Since galaxies are usually observed to have elliptical light distributions, mass distributions with elliptical density contours offer more general and realistic lens models. They are difficult to use, however, since previous studies have shown that the deflection angle (and magnification) in this case can only be obtained by rather expensive numerical integrations. We present a family of lens models for which the deflection can be calculated to high relative accuracy (one part in 100000) with a greatly reduced numerical effort, for small and large ellipticity alike. This makes it easier to use these distributions for modelling individual lenses as well as for applications requiring larger computing times, such as statistical lensing studies. A program implementing this method can be obtained from the author (or at http://www.sns.ias.edu/$\sim$barkana/ellip.html).},

        abstract = {We report the discovery of a new quadruply imaged quasar surrounded by an optical Einstein ring candidate. Spectra of the different components of 1RXS J113155.4-123155 reveal a source at z = 0.658. Up to now, this object is the closest known gravitationally lensed quasar. The lensing galaxy is clearly detected. Its redshift is measured to be z = 0.295. Additionally, the total V magnitude of the system has varied by 0.3 mag between two epochs separated by 33 weeks. The measured relative astrometry of the lensed images is best fitted with an SIS model plus shear. This modeling suggests very high magnification of the source (up to 50 for the total magnification) and predicts flux ratios between the lensed images significantly different from what is actually observed. This suggests that the lensed images may be affected by a combination of micro or milli-lensing and dust extinction effects.},

Astronomers unfamiliar with optical simulation techniques need access to PSF models that properly match the conditions of their observations, so any HST modeling software needs to be both easy-to-use and have detailed information on the telescope and instruments. The Tiny Tim PSF simulation software package has been the standard HST modeling software since its release in early 1992. We discuss the evolution of Tiny Tim over the years as new instruments and optical properties have been incorporated. We also demonstrate how Tiny Tim PSF models have been used for HST data analysis.

@article{Peng2002,
abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2-D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas, by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components, and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use 2-D models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the Sersic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position-angle twists can be modeled accurately in 2-D. When examined in detail, we find that even simple-looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. We illustrate this by way of 7 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare 2-D and 1-D extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei.},
