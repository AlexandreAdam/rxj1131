abstract = {Nested sampling estimates directly how the likelihood function relates to prior mass. The evidence (alternatively the marginal likelihood, marginal density of the data, or the prior predictive) is immediately obtained by summation. It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the "nested"contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic relabelling) allows the method to deal with a class of phasechange problems which effectively defeat thermal annealing. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.},

abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful technique for probing galaxy mass distributions and for measuring cosmological parameters. Lens systems with extended source-intensity distributions are particularly useful for this purpose since they provide additional constraints on the lens potential (mass distribution). We present a pixelated approach to modeling the lens potential and source-intensity distribution simultaneously. The method makes iterative and perturbative corrections to an initial potential model. For systems with sources of sufficient extent such that the separate lensed images are connected by intensity measurements, the accuracy in the reconstructed potential is solely limited by the quality of the data. We apply this potential reconstruction technique to deep Hubble Space Telescope observations of B1608+656, a four-image gravitational lens system formed by a pair of interacting lens galaxies. We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the system that takes into account the extended source-intensity distribution, dust extinction, and the interacting lens galaxies. Our approach allows us to compare various models of the components of the lens system, which include the point-spread function (PSF), dust, lens galaxy light, source-intensity distribution, and lens potential. Using optimal combinations of the PSF, dust, and lens galaxy light models, we successfully reconstruct both the lens potential and the extended source-intensity distribution of B1608+656. The resulting reconstruction can be used as the basis of a measurement of the Hubble constant. As an illustration of the astrophysical applications of our method, we use our reconstruction of the gravitational potential to study the relative distribution of mass and light in the lensing galaxies. We find that the mass-to-light ratio for the primary lens galaxy is (2.0 ± 0.2)h M{\textregistered} L -1B,{\textregistered}, within the Einstein radius (3.9 h-1 kpc), in agreement with what is found for noninteracting lens galaxies at the same scales. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {The time delays between the multiple images of a strong lens system, together with a model of the lens mass distribution, allow a one-step measurement of a cosmological distance, namely, the 'time-delay distance' of the lens (D $\Delta$t) that encodes cosmological information. The time-delay distance depends sensitively on the radial profile slope of the lens mass distribution; consequently, the lens slope must be accurately constrained for cosmological studies. We show that the slope cannot be constrained in two-image systems with single-component compact sources, whereas it can be constrained in systems with two-component sources provided that the separation between the image components can be measured with milliarcsecond precisions, which is not feasible in most systems. In contrast, we demonstrate that spatially extended images of the source galaxy in two-image systems break the radial slope degeneracy and allow D $\Delta$t to be measured with uncertainties of a few per cent. Deep and high-resolution imaging of the lens systems are needed to reveal the extended arcs, and stable point spread functions are required for our lens modelling technique. Two-image systems, no longer plagued by the radial profile slope degeneracy, would augment the sample of useful time-delay lenses by a factor of ∼6, providing substantial advances for cosmological studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {We introduce dynamic nested sampling: A generalisation of the nested sampling algorithm in which the number of "live points" varies to allocate samples more efficiently. In empirical tests the new method significantly improves calculation accuracy compared to standard nested sampling with the same number of samples; this increase in accuracy is equivalent to speeding up the computation by factors of up to ∼ 72 for parameter estimation and ∼ 7 for evidence calculations. We also show that the accuracy of both parameter estimation and evidence calculations can be improved simultaneously. In addition, unlike in standard nested sampling, more accurate results can be obtained by continuing the calculation for longer. Popular standard nested sampling implementations can be easily adapted to perform dynamic nested sampling, several dynamic nested sampling software packages are now publicly available. 1.},
